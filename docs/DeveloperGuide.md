## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -activity 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TravelPlannerPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `WanderlustParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a travel plan).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -activity 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -activity 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the travel planner data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<TravelPlan>`, `ObservableList<Activity>`, `ObservableList<Accommodation>`, `ObservableList<Friend>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the travel planner data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find Feature

#### Implementation

Current implementation of Find feature is facilitated by `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` which implements 
`Predicate<Nameable>` and has the **test** method overriden with a custom implementations.
 
The `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate#test(Nameable)` is as follows:  
* loops through the **keywords** (of type `List<String>`) and return true if there is any match with the `Nameable`

`Nameable` provides the following operation:
* `Nameable#getName()` - Return the name attribute of a `TravelPlanObject`

`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be passed to `Model#updateFilteredXYZList(Predicate)` 
(`updateFilteredActivityList`, etc.). The filtered list will then be updated according to the given `Predicate` and 
automatically reflected on the Ui.

The class diagram shows the relevant classes involved:

![FindCommandClassDiagram](images/DGFindCommandClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the find command:

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

### Changing Directory

#### Implementation

>>>>>>> 2a5a5a3bcce887e03175099db9afa04f236e6fc2
*travel plan* or *wishlist* easily. Starting up *Wanderlust* will show the default view of a *wishlist* and users
can use the `goto` command to navigate to their desired directory.

`TravelPlannerPanel`, `TravelPlanPanel` and `TravelPlanObjectListPanel` provide the core components for the display of
*Wanderlust*. When we are in the directory of *travelplan* or *wishlist*, `MainWindow` renders all 3 of the above
components. `TravelPlannerPanel` highlights the directory we are currently in, `TravelPlanPanel` displays the `name` of the
directory and if it is a *travelplan*, it will show the `date` of the *travelplan* as well. Lastly, `TravelPlanObjectListPanel`
displays the respective `activity`, `accommodation` and `friend` list in the UI of a particular directory. Do note that
`wishlist` should not contain any `accommodation` or `friend` list. (The UI should not be displaying anything)

Both `TravelPlannerPanel` and `TravelPlanObjectListPanel` make use of JavaFX's `ListView` to display the list of `travelplan`
or `activity`/`accommodation`/`friend` respectively.

`TravelPlannerPanel` utilizes JavaFX's `Label` to display the `name` of the directory.

`TravelPlanObjectListPanel` utilizes `TabPane` and `Tab` to display the different `activity`/`accommodation`/`friend` tabs
respectively.

The class diagram below shows the relevant classes involved:

![GoToUiClassDiagram](images/GoToUiClassDiagram.png)

#### Navigating between directories

`MainWindow` and `CommandResult` facilitates the navigation between directories.

Firstly, `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()` initializes an `OberservableDirectory` which **listens** to any directory changes.
`MainWindow#executeCommand()` is then called when user enters a `goto` command into the application. `MainWindow#executeCommand()`
initializes all changes to what is displayed by the UI by calling `Logic#execute()` which returns a `CommandResult`.
From `Logic#execute()`, `MainWindow#handleDirectoryChange()` will navigate the current directory to the one input by the user, changing the
UI to view the new directory. From `CommandResult`, the `ResultDisplay` Ui will then output a text specifying which directory
has been navigated to.

The activity diagram below illustrates the flow of execution when the UI decides which directory to view:

![GoToUiActivityDiagram](images/GoToUiActivityDiagram.png)

Below is a sequence diagram that shows a scenario whereby the UI navigates to a specified `travelplan` in `Wanderlust`:

![GoToUiSequenceDiagram](images/GoToUiSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration:

Aspect: How navigation between directory works

- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Initializing an observable directory in Wanderlust.
  - Pros: Main Window will always be listen to any changes in directory, allowing UI to switch fast
  - Cons: More work has to be done to sync up the UI with the model as we have to create an ObservableDirectory class and
  link to the model manager.

- **Alternative 2**: Passing the Directory as a parameter in CommandResult method
  - Pros: Easy to implement since we just have to return a new CommandResult which has an additional parameter of Directory.
  - Cons: Break the abstraction layer as Commands (Logic) should not have to be aware of how the Model is working.


### Adding a TravelPlan or TravelPlanObject

#### Implementation

*Wanderlust*'s Ui allows users to add a `TravelPlan` to the `TravelPlanner`, an `Activity` to the `Wishlist` and a `TravelPlanObject`
to the `TravelPlan` in the current directory.

`MainWindow#executeCommand()` is called when the user enters a `add` command into the application. `MainWindow#executeCommand()`
adds the TravelPlan/TravelPlanObject by calling `Logic#execute()` which returns a `CommandResult`. `Logic#execute()` also sets the
the `Directory` of the `ObservableDirectory` to the updated `Directory` after adding the TravelPlan/TravelPlanObject so the Ui displays
the updated list of `TravelPlan`s/`TravelPlanObject`s. From `CommandResult`, the `ResultDisplay` Ui will then output a text confirming
to the user that the command was successfully executed.

The activity diagram below shows a scenario whereby a user adds inputs an add command:

![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows a scenario whereby a user adds an `Activity` to the `TravelPlan`/`Wishlist` in the current directory:

![AddActivitySequenceDiagram](images/AddActivitySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration:

Aspect: How to add `TravelPlanObject`s to the `TravelPlan` in the current `Directory`

- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Use individual add commands for each sub-class of `TravelPlanObject`.
  - Pros: Greater abstraction and a more logical implementation since there is a command for each sub-class.
  - Cons: Greater repetition of code.

- **Alternative 2**: Using a `AddTravelPlanObjectCommand` class.
  - Pros: Lesser repetition of code.
  - Cons: Lesser abstraction.


### Copy feature

#### Implementation
The copy mechanism supports copying an `activity` from `Wishlist` to a specific `TravelPlan`. It is facilitated by the
add mechanism, except activities can be added to **any** `TravelPlan`  in the `TravelPlanner`, referenced by their index
*(travel plan index)*. The copy mechanism adds a **deep copy** of the activity in `Wishlist` to the specified `TravelPlan`,
not the same instance. Thus, if any activity was edited in one directory, it should not affect all other copies.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The copy command can only be called when
the current directory is the wishlist. Hence, index used to reference activities *(activity index)* refers to that in
the `filteredWishlist` in `Model`. This means, even if the `find` command is used to filter the activities in the
wishlist, the indexes in the `filteredWishlist` will be updated accordingly (and so will the Ui). Hence, as long as the
user uses the index as displayed in the Ui, the correct activity will be referenced.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the copy operation works:

![CopySequenceDiagram](images/CopySequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CopyCommandParser` and
`CopyCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of
diagram.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The indexes used by CopyCommand in the `execute()` method (after parsing) is zero-based.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `copy` command:

![CopyActivityDiagram](images/CopyActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

Aspect: How to duplicate activity *(deep/shallow copy)*
- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Using a deep copy.
    - Pros: More flexibility to have different variations of the activity in different directories (e.g. different dates/times, etc).
    - Cons: Each instance is not synced with the rest. Users have to update each copy separately if they wish to do so.
    *However, there is flexibility to extend other commands (e.g. Edit command) to update all deep copies of the same activity.*
- **Alternative 2**: Using a shallow copy.
    - Pros: Only one instance of each activity means users can update all copies of the activity at once.
    - Cons: Less flexibility to change a copied activity without affecting other copies.
- **Alternative 3**: Have variations of the copy command to allow both deep/shallow copy.
    - Pros: Best of both worlds. Allows for flexibility and convenience at the same time.
    - Cons: Harder to implement. Users need a way to differentiate deep/shallow copies to avoid unintentionally editing
    a shallow copy. Potentially more edge cases to think about and handle.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
